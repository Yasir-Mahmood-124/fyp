# Model-Driven Development Platform (No-Code to Low-Code)

## 🚀 Overview

This project presents a **Model-Driven Development (MDD)** approach aimed at bridging the gap between no-code and low-code development. It allows **non-technical users** to design applications using a **drag-and-drop interface**, which are then **automatically transformed into customizable low-code models** for developers.

## 🎯 Purpose

To streamline the web application development process by:
- Enabling non-developers to contribute through visual tools.
- Reducing manual coding for developers.
- Enhancing collaboration between stakeholders.
- Providing a scalable backend to manage and deploy models efficiently.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Drag-and-drop No-Code Interface for app design.
- 🔁 Automated transformation from No-Code to Low-Code models.
- ⚙️ Backend API to manage:
  - Model interpretation
  - CRUD operations
  - Version control & deployment
- 🗄️ Secure Database Integration.
- 🤝 Collaborative environment for developers & non-technical users.
- 📈 Scalable system architecture for multiple projects.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js (No-code interface)
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express (API Layer)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Model Parser**: XML/JSON to Code Transformer
- **Deployment**: Docker / Vercel / Railway / Firebase Hosting

## 🧪 Functional Requirements

### Admin Panel
- Manage users and roles
- Deploy and version models
- View system usage analytics

### User Panel
- Create and design applications visually
- Edit and manage existing models
- Preview and export generated low-code models
